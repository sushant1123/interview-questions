Round 1:
machine coding questions
    Capitalize first letter of each word in a given string (prototype way)
    
    infinite currying of sum(1)(2)(3)(4)....
    const sum = (x) => {
        return (y)=>{
            if(y) {
                return sum(x+y);
            } else {
                return x;
            }
        }
    }
    or in simple words
    const sum = x => y => y ? sum(x+y) : x;
    console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)()); //10
    
    sum = (a) => a+1;
    multiply = (b) => a*2;
    pipe(sum, multiply)
