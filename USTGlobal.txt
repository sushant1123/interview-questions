Round 1:
project overview
React features compared to other frameworks
state vs props
virtual DOM in react
difference between var, let and const. 
why Redux is required.
React routing.
css frameworks.
multithreading in nodejs
setInterval vs setTimeout
process.nextTick vs process.setImmediate.

process.nextTick():
Fires immediately on the same phase of the event loop, and is processed at the beginning of the event loop and between each phase. 
It adds callbacks to the nextTickQueue, which is executed immediately after the current phase ends. The loop will block until the callback is resolved completely.

setImmediate():
Fires on the following iteration or "tick" of the event loop, and is processed in the Check handlers phase. 
It adds callbacks to the event queue, which are executed during the check phase. 


code snippet:

const a = [5,6,7,8];
if(typeof a == typeof(null)) {
    console.log("its me");
} else {
    console.log("its you");
}
